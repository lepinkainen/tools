# Tools

A collection of simple browser-based tools, inspired by [Simon Willison's tools](https://tools.simonwillison.net).

## Live Site

The tools are deployed at: https://lepinkainen.github.io/tools/

## How It Works

1. **Tools**: Each tool is a single HTML file in the root directory (e.g., `joiner.html`)
2. **Styling**: All tools share a common stylesheet (`common.css`) for consistent appearance
3. **Build Process**: The `build.py` script:
   - Scans for all `.html` files in the root directory
   - Creates a `dist/` directory structure
   - Deploys each tool to `dist/toolname/index.html`
   - Generates an index page listing all available tools
4. **Deployment**: GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to main

## Setup GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. To enable automatic deployment:

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
3. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. The workflow will automatically deploy on every push to the main branch

The workflow file needs to be added manually to your repository (automated tools cannot create workflow files for security reasons).

## Adding a New Tool

1. Create a new HTML file in the root directory (e.g., `mytool.html`)
2. Link to the common stylesheet in the `<head>`:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../common.css" />
   ```
3. Use the common CSS classes for consistent styling (see `common.css`)
4. Commit and push - GitHub Actions will automatically deploy it!

Your tool will be available at: `https://lepinkainen.github.io/tools/mytool/`

## Local Development

To build the site locally:

```bash
python build.py
```

The built site will be in the `dist/` directory. You can serve it locally with:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory dist 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000

## CSS Classes

The common stylesheet provides these ready-to-use classes:

- `.container` - Centered content container
- `.box` - Bordered box with hover effects
- `.output` - Output/result display area
- `.secondary` - Secondary button style
- Utility classes: `.text-left`, `.text-center`, `.mt-*`, `.mb-*`

See `common.css` for all available styles.
